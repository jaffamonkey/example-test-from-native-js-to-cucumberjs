The simplest API call is retrieving a web page, which returns a status code of 200 (OK).

But there is a lot you can do at API level.

There is a most API server code in the `api` folder, as a demonstration of both api server and tests for:

* `GET` For example, retrieving a webpage
* `POST` For example, sending a contact form
