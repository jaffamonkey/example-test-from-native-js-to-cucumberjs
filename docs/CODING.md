# Are you ready to work from the CLI?

In many ways, it is a lot quicker to do basic git operations from the CLI (Command Line Interface)

First download a free code editor, like Visual Studo Code.

In order to securely and more easily clone repos from your machine, you need to add an SSH key to GitHub, so GitHub know you are on an authorised machine.

Assuming you have installed Git for Windows, open up the GitBash program which will open up CLI window.
